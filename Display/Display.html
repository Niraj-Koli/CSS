            <span class="inline">Sasuke Uchiha</span> is one of the last
            surviving members of
            <span class="inline">Konohagakure's Uchiha clan</span>. After his
            older brother, <span class="inline">Itachi</span>, slaughtered their
            clan, <span class="inline">Sasuke</span> made it his mission in life
            to avenge them by killing <span class="inline">Itachi</span>. He is
            added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with
            his rival and best friend,
            <span class="inline">Naruto Uzumaki</span>,
            <span class="inline">Sasuke</span> starts developing his skills.
            Dissatisfied with his progress, he defects from Konoha so that he
            can acquire the strength needed to exact his
            <span class="inline">revenge</span>. His years of seeking
            <span class="inline">vengeance</span> and his actions that followed
            become increasingly demanding, irrational and isolates him from
            others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal.
            After learning the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving
            instrumental in ending the
            <span class="inline">Fourth Shinobi World War</span>, and being
            happily redeemed by <span class="inline">Naruto</span>,
            <span class="inline">Sasuke</span> decides to return to Konoha and
            dedicate his life to help protect the village and its inhabitants,
            becoming referred to as the
            <span class="inline">"Supporting Kage"</span>.
