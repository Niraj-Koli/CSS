        <div class="gohanclear">
            Son Gohan is a half-breed Saiyan and one of the most prominent
            characters in the Dragon Ball series. He is the elder son of the
            series' primary protagonist Goku and his wife Chi-Chi, the older
            brother of Goten, the husband of Videl and father to Pan. He is
            named after Goku's adoptive grandfather, Gohan. Unlike his father,
            Gohan lacks a passion for fighting (although, he does possess a
            strong power within him) and prefers to do so only when his loved
            ones are threatened. Nevertheless, Gohan fights alongside the Dragon
            Team in the defense of Earth for much of his life.

        <div class="kanekiclear">
            Ken Kaneki is the main protagonist of the Tokyo Ghoul series. He is
            currently Touka Kirishima's husband, and the father of Ichika
            Kaneki. Previously, he was a student who studied Japanese literature
            at Kamii University, living a relatively normal life. However, this
            quickly changed after Rize Kamishiro's kakuhou was transplanted into
            him and transformed him into a one-eyed ghoul. Kaneki is the first
            known artificial one-eyed ghoul. His unique half ghoul state is what
            later inspires the idea of the Quinx. After joining Anteiku as a
            part-time waiter, he learns how to live as a ghoul and eventually
            becomes known as Eyepatch.
